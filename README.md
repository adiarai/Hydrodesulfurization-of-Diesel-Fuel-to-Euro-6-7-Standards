Project Background
With the growing number of diesel-powered vehicles, sulfur emissions have become a major environmental concern. While developed countries have already adopted Euro III, IV, and V fuels, many developing regions, including Pakistan, had only mandated Euro II specifications at the time. This project aimed to design an industrial-scale plant capable of producing ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) that meets Euro 6/7 standards, replacing outdated specifications and minimizing harmful emissions.

Technical Overview
Plant Capacity: 22,000 barrels/day

Hydrogen Requirement: 6,000 kg/hr

Desulfurized Product Output: 1,149,120 kg/hr

By-products: 32,580 kg/hr of desulfurized fuel and light gases

Energy Consumption: 156,424,256.7 kJ/hr

Capital Cost Estimate: USD 11,050,252.05

Process Description
The process begins with hydrodesulfurization reactions inside a trickle bed reactor, where sulfur compounds in diesel are converted to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in the presence of hydrogen gas and a catalyst. These exothermic reactions take place under controlled temperature and pressure conditions. The H₂S gas is removed in a separator and then absorbed in a diethanolamine (DEA) absorber, while unreacted hydrogen is recovered and recycled.

A stripper column removes lighter gases from the desulfurized diesel. These gases are redirected to a naphtha treating unit. The bottom product is the final ultra-low sulfur diesel, ready for market.

Major Equipment Specifications
Trickle Bed Reactor: Diameter 3.3 m

Shell & Tube Heat Exchanger: Tube OD 38 mm, ID 34 mm

Tray Absorber: 18 m height

Separator: 37.33 sec holdup time

Stripper Column: 21 theoretical trays, 47.15 m height

Control & Safety
The design integrates essential process control loops across all major equipment to ensure safe operation, maximize efficiency, and maintain product quality. Special attention is given to monitoring catalyst performance and reactor temperatures.

Challenges & Future Prospects
A key limitation of the HDS process is catalyst deactivation over time, requiring periodic regeneration or replacement. Research is ongoing into alternative methods, such as solvent extraction, to further improve desulfurization efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Impact
This project demonstrates a practical and scalable solution for upgrading diesel fuel to meet Euro 6/7 standards. It highlights the role of chemical process engineering in tackling real-world environmental challenges and enabling cleaner energy solutions.
